# Functional-Verification-CalcII
The aim of the project was to verify functional correctness of the given black box design through simulation-based verification:testing, checking and coverage of discovering bugs .  In this project, we utilized the CAD tool ”QuestaSim” to perform a functional simulation and System verilog language is used for random and direct test cases.
